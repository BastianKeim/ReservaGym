I did a little programm using python and selenium.

What the programm does is book me the next hour by getting the current hour, fill the parameters automatically and finally book.

this proccess used to take me 5 minutes to do it, with this automated programm it was reduced to 30 seconds. 

The actual version has some raw inputs, so if you try to use it IS NOT going to work. I beg you to no use the programm, it's just for education purpose, but feel free to take ideas and code from it, of course.

I'm working for the next version so it can save different data from different people and can be used by everyone enrolled in the same gym that I go.
